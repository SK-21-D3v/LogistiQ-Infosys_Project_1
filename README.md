<H1>LogistiQ- AI Driven Supply Chain Disruption Predictor and Inventory Optimization System</H1>

**Project Statement:**

This project aims to develop an advanced AI-powered system that revolutionizes supply chain management by monitoring global supply chain data, predicting potential disruptions, and optimizing inventory levels accordingly. By leveraging LLMs like OpenAI GPT, Meta LLaMA for natural language processing and data analysis, integrating with Google Sheets, and utilizing Slack or Email for real-time alerts, the system will provide predictive insights on supply chain risks and automate inventory adjustments. This comprehensive solution will enable businesses to proactively manage supply chain disruptions, optimize inventory levels, and maintain operational continuity in the face of global uncertainties.

Outcomes:<br>
● Accurate prediction of supply chain disruptions through analysis of news,
supplier data, and transportation trends.<br>
● Dynamic inventory level optimization based on predicted supply chain
reliability and disruption risks.<br>
● Real-time notifications and ERP integration for immediate inventory
adjustments and reordering recommendations. <br>
● Significant reduction in supply chain-related losses and improved operational
efficiency through proactive risk management.<br>

**Overview:** 

A Python-based system designed to streamline supply chain operations and optimize inventory management. This project incorporates **machine learning models** for predicting supply chain risks and analyzing inventory data to ensure efficient decision-making. The system uses **PostgreSQL** as the database and **Streamlit** for an interactive web dashboard.  


## Features  
- **Data Fetching**: Incorporates APIs for fetching external supply chain-related data.
- **Database Integration**: Stores and retrieves supply chain data from a **PostgreSQL** database.
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Provides a visual representation of supply chain insights using **Streamlit**.
- **Inventory Analysis**: Analyzes inventory levels, demand patterns, and trends for better inventory control.  
- **Risk Prediction**: Integrates machine learning models to predict risks in the supply chain.    


## Technology Stack  
- **Backend**: Python (with libraries such as `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `psycopg2`, `requests`)  
- **Database**: PostgreSQL  
- **Frontend**: Streamlit  
- **Visualization**: Plotly, Matplotlib  
- **Environment Management**: Python-dotenv  


## Prerequisites  
Before setting up the project, ensure you have the following installed:  
- Python 3.7+  
- PostgreSQL database  
- Required Python libraries (specified in `requirements.txt`)
